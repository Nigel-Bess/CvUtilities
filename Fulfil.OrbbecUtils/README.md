# Fulfil.OrbbecHelpers

All Orbbec-specific utils go here so all improvements to Orbbec-specific logic is shared across all CV apps.  It's setup as a twin of Fulfil.CPPUtils except it only has a handful of classes that help with Orbbec camera integration.

Import like this:

`#include <Fulfil.OrbbecUtils/orbbec/orbbec_manager.h>;`
