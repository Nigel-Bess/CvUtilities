# Repack service

The repack service runs only in PLM and responds to FC with requests for whether a bag is empty in a particular Bay.

# CI/CD

Open a PR to auto-build a branch in prod GCR of the same name.  Merging your PR will also rebuild the main branch which is used by PLM.


TODO: Better CD, currently a manual restart is required to pull the latest main image.
