A small collection of scripts to generate Aruco tag images.  You'll need Python 3 installed, then installed dependencies with:

```
pip3 install -r scripts/aruco/requirements.txt
```

Now you can run scripts such as:

```
python3 scripts/aruco/generate_lfr_8_dict.py
```

Output Aruco images will be saved to `scripts/aruco/images`
