# Fulfil.DepthCam

The goal of this library is to simplify the use of the realsense depth cameras and the code 
required for common use cases, including: 
converting point clouds to different coordinate systems, 
loading data from saved files, 
integration with aruco tags, 
and visualizing point clouds and depth data.
